# Purpose and Objective

## PyCon Korea welcomes all participants
The PyCon Korea Code of Conduct (after this called COC) is the most basic promise that all members must observe to create a Python Community that welcomes everyone.

PyCon Korea:
*   Aims to create events that anyone can participate
*   Aims to create an atmosphere where all forms of differences are accepted and respected.
*    Aims to create a conference where all participants are treated equally regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, race, region, religion, age, social status, education, intellectual level, appearance, disability, disease, preferred diets, and so forth.
*   Aims to encourage an atmosphere that welcomes everyone.


## Why is it important to embrace all participants?
PyCon Korea believes that an attitude of respecting diversity is the source of making society and the community more abundant. To find solutions to solve difficult problems and help the community to continue to grow and bring about positive changes to the world, it is necessary to have various experiences and perspectives are needed.

## PyCon Korea does not tolerate discrimination and harassment
Accordance with the Code of Conduct, the PyCon Korea Organizing Team, can:
*   Intervene or restrict situations where the safety of another participant/s is/are violated or if that person is not being respected.
*   Expel participants who violated the Code of Conduct from the event space (venue, official social media channels, or Slack workspace), if necessary. In this case, participation fees will not be refunded.
*   Report the situation to judicial or medical institutes if necessary or if requested to do so.

## The Code of Conduct applies to all situations related to the event
The Code of Conduct applies to events hosted by Python user groups, processes accompanying the event, and all participants taking part in such processes.
*   Applies to all participants (speakers, cooperative organizations, sponsors, volunteers, Organizing Team, etc.).
*   Applies to all communication channels to PyCon Korea Organizing Team, including event dates.
*   Applies to all places, processes, and outcomes including presentation materials, venue, website, booklets, mail, social media, meetings, code repository, and other places are connected with the event or the community.

## Please read carefully
This does not contain the entire list of things that you should not do. What is more important is to truly comprehend the intent of the contents of this Code of Conduct and use it as a guideline to treat each other better. Rather than following this Code of Conduct to the letter, we would like to advise you to think about the consequences and reasoning of the specific action with the CoC in mind.

# Community
## Let's create a welcoming mood
All participants should feel that they are welcomed, regardless of their background. People who feel that they are marginalized or not welcomed will hesitate to take part in the community. Please create a welcoming mood to help the Python community grow.
*   Please treat beginners or first-time visitors to the event kindly and warmly.
*   Be brave.
    *   If you are more comfortable just listening or watching, then that is fine too. But, if you feel hesitation at a time when you want to participate in a conversation, remember that the people who are talking actively next to you may have also met for the first time today.
*   Please react.
    *   A person might have had to build up the courage to talk to you.
        *   Please answer kindly to questions or requests for assistance.
        *   Express your appreciation for responses.

## Make PyCon Korea safe

    *   Presuming that a counterpart has lower intellectual levels based on the mere fact of being a woman and trying to explain too much
*   Do not use sexual orientation, gender identity, or sexual expressions as jokes or belittlement expressions.
    * "Are you gay?", "Your hair is so short that you look like a lesbian."
*   Do not discriminate by age, social status, or seniority.

    * "This is why nobody can get along with people who support the OO party."
*   Be careful not to make unnecessary assessments or make discriminatory comments about the appearance of someone.
    * "You look (do not look) like a developer."
    *   (When describing someone) "That pretty-looking female developer."
*   Do not act based on biases that people with disabilities always need help.
    *   Behaving based on your thoughts without being asked is interference. You should first check the intent of the person and offer your services according to the requested method.

    * "You didn't major in this, so you probably won't know."

Your form of speech and behavior may be taken differently by from what you intended. Stop your speech and behavior as soon as possible if the other person feels uncomfortable.

## Do not pretend that you are a member of the PyCon Korea Organizing Team or a staff, or distribute false information.
Impersonation of staff can confuse the participants with false information, and people in need may not get the help they need in time. The PyCon Korea Organizing Team does not publish or distribute the information other than the official channels. It is to prevent the disadvantages of the information divide among attendees.
*   Do not intentionally do anything, such as having similar profile images or nicknames to the staff,  that can be identified as a staff at the event space.
    *   If it's needed, we can ask you to change the profile.
*   Do not distribute information, not from the official channels, such as website, official social media, emails from PyCon Korea's account, etc.
    * "A friend of mine from the PyCon Korea Organizing Team says things like this."

# Communication
## Please respect the speaker when speaking
*   Do not engage in behavior or make noises that can disturb speakers or listeners during presentations.
*   Do not stop the speaker until he or she clearly states his or her intent that it is okay. Ask questions according to the prescribed time with the prescribed method.

## Discussions are mutual
Many people participate in conversations in various places, like Open Space, PyCon Korea's public Slack channel for the conference, and YouTube Channel. Always remember that the opinion of others is just as important as yours. Do not interfere with the conversation by cutting others off, raising your voice, or sending repetitive messages.
*   Please take precautions so that a few people do not take excessive amounts of speaking opportunities. Let everyone have equal chances to speak.
*   Even if you have a dispute with another person, treat that person in a respectful attitude.

## Have constructive discussions
We all have different backgrounds and knowledge. It is natural for people to have different opinions.

Constructive criticism and condemnation are different. Constructive criticism can help with the development of the community and its members. But condemnation focusing on bringing others down or to hurting others is strictly prohibited. If you have a different opinion from another person, state your opinion in a respectful and proper attitude. Have an accepting attitude towards proper criticism, which may help you build your knowledge base.
*   Use respectful expressions. Here are some examples of what not to do.
    *   That language/library/operating system is garbage (X)
    *   I think that the language/library/operating system has a OO weakness (O)
*   Criticize content, not people.
    *   People who believe in the OO theory are idiots (X)
    *   The OO theory does not have enough evidential support (O)
*   Concentrate on alternatives and not flaws or problems.
*   Do not try to humiliate others to show off your knowledge.

## Do not engage in one-sided propaganda or incitement
Individual thoughts and political preferences must be respected. However, one-sided propaganda or incitement that can interfere with the smooth participation in events by other participants or irrelevant to the context is prohibited.
*   Adding political slogans or similar political innuendos in presentation slides
*   Chanting and yelling slogans in groups in front of booths
*   Interfering others' communication by promoting a content repetitively and continuously on PyCon Korea's official social media, PyCon Korea's public Slack channel, or PyCon Korea's YouTube channel.

# Privacy
## Be careful when taking photos or videos
Always respect the intent of the person being filmed when taking a photo or video. Some people may not want to be in photos or videos.
*   All events operated by the PyCon Korea Organizing Team have plans for people who do not want to be in videos or photos.
    *   The detailed method for expressing your intent will be notified for each event.
*   When the event is held online, the following rules will apply:
    *   Do not capture the presentation video without the speaker's consent.

## Protect personal information
*   Do not include any information that can identify someone without their permission.
*   Do not capture or distribute the chat log, profile, or any personal information without their consent.
*   If your counterpart does not want to answer a question, do not ask again. Please respect the intent of others.
*   Please understand that information that may not be sensitive to you may not be the same for others.
*   Some questions can be rude no matter how you ask it. (please refrain from asking the following)
    * "How old are you?"
    * "Are you married?", "Do you have a child?" "Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend/partner?"
    * "What kind of medication do you take?"
    * "How did you become disabled?"

# Profit-seeking Behavior
PyCon Korea prohibits the profit-seeking behavior of unauthorized organizations. Profit-seeking behavior includes selling items to gain profits and all actions that an individual or organization can gain monetary profits, whether in the short-term or long-term.
*   Approaching participants and asking for personal information for reasons such as employment opportunities, etc.
*   Distributing flyers at the venue without authorization
*   Other profit-seeking activities

Suppose profit-seeking activity not authorized by PyCon Korea is discovered. In that case, legal measures may be taken for the smooth operation of the event.

# Public Manners
PyCon Korea's event venue is a public space attended by many people. Please keep public manners so that it can be an event for everyone to enjoy pleasantly.

## Keep the noise down that can interfere with the presentation
*   Videos/music played in high volume without using earphones or headphones
*   Holding auxiliary events using microphones or amplifiers

## Keep the venue clean
*   Observe the rules of the venue where the event is held.
*   Clean up after yourself.
*   Throw garbage in the garbage can. Observe the recycling rules.

# Reporting
## The Reporting process is as follows

*   The staff are trained on how to react to violations to the Code of Conduct.
*   The staff will be wearing t-shirts that stand out in offline venues. The staff can be reached via email above.

When a violation of the Code of Conduct report is received, the PyCon Korea Organizing Team shall protect the participant immediately according to [Attendee Procedure for incident handling](https://github.com/pythonkr/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/english/Attendee%20Procedure%20for%20incident%20handling.md).

## The Code of Conduct has the following limitations
Despite various efforts to create a safe and pleasant community, the Code of Conduct cannot provide complete protection for participants from all threats.
*   In the case of emergencies, request help from the staff and also file a report to the competent authorities such as the police or fire station.
